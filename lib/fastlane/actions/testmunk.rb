# How it works:
# You can run your functional calabash testcases on real ios hardware.
# Follow the steps to set up your free account on testmunk.com or see below.
# After tests are executed you will get an email with test results.
# An API extension to see test results directly in Jenkins is in the works.

# Setup
# 1) Create a free account on testmunk.com
# 2) Create an own project under your account (top right) after you are logged in. You will need to use this project name within your REST API upload path.
# 3) Upload testcases (features in calabash) over the testmunk REST API (http://docs.testmunk.com/en/latest/rest.html#upload-testcases).
